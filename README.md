# ImportingTextFiles

This repository holds material that show the[readtext-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readtext/vignettes/readtext_vignette.html) in action. The repository is meant as a continuation to the workshop on [Text Mining St. Croix Avis](https://github.com/maxodsbjerg/TextMiningStCroixAvis) to show how to import local text files into R. 

## Setting up
I recommend that you download this repository as a .zip file and extract it on your machine. The next step is to open `ImportingTextFiles.Rproj`, which will open a Rstudio-project. In this Rstudio you should open the file `ImportingTextFilesNotebook.Rmd`, which will be located in the files-panel (typically in right lower side).  

When you want to import your own files into R I strongly recommend [setting up a project in Rstudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) and learning a little bit about how [R navigates filesystems](https://github.com/VictorHarbo/Introduktion_til_paths)
